                <div class="col-2-of-3">


                    <p>I’m Dionis, everyone calls me Denis, except for Border Force officers when they see my ID.</p>

                    <p>I’m a self-taught UI Designer and Front-End Developer.</p>

                    <p>I first got in contact with coding, when I tried to customize my Blogspot XML template. It was 2007,
                        I was 15. Instead of chasing girls I was turned on day and night by knowing that I do something different,
                        I was making my own pocket money with Adsense. I simply can’t describe the feeling when my mom had
                        to cash out my checks, I wasn’t old enough to do it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Soon after, I discovered Blogger’s limitations. I abandoned ship and began searching for a better solution.
                        That’s when I found out the great, mighty unlimited possibilities, Wordpress.</p>

                    <p>Learning Wordpress opened new doors for me. For a period of time,
                        <a href="https://flippa.com/2654120-zenmovies-com">I sold websites on Flippa</a> when Flippa was in her heyday. That provided me with enough money to
                        live independently while I was in high-school. This time I had enough pocket money to go and buy
                        furniture for my rented apartment. I guess the saying “money is power” is true after all.</p>

                    <p>Besides selling websites, some of the buyers asked me to help them with different web projects.</p>

                    <p>Flippa’s glory came to an end and that sent me on a new adventure. To provide web development services
                        through
                        <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01a232bec2da0b9922">Elance (now Upwork)</a>. I had the experience, knowledge of building numerous websites, from simple
                        HTML & CSS to Magento shops, Automated Wordpress websites, etc. It was time to cash on what I knew
                        to do.
                    </p>

                    <p>After a few failed attempts to compete with low bids, soon enough, the first job came in, then second,
                        third and so on. Every client I had were happy with the quality of my services. Of course, to make
                        them feel that way, I sometimes went above and beyond of what was expected from me.</p>

                    <p>Pretty much all my freelance clients wanted to continue working with me after we got one project done.
                        I ended up having several long-term projects. That led me to the idea of having my own design agency
                        and scale what I had going.</p>

                    <p>Of course, I tried doing it, but I failed miserably. I found that you need to be a strong leader, salesman,
                        marketer, mentor. And I was none of these, In my mind I was thinking, with enough time I can try
                        teach myself those skills with books and courses. But these, unfortunately, are qualities you develop
                        while doing, it takes a lot of practice and time.</p>

                    <p>I now moved to the UK, and looking for new challenges.</p>
